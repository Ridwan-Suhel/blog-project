## Project Brief:

Welcome to my Blog project a robust, scalable and feature rich API for creating beautiful blog. Designed to facilitate user interaction through creating, updating, and deleting blogs while ensuring secure and efficient access control.

### Key features:
User role and permission
- Admin role: 
    - Manage users, including editing, or blocking user accounts.
    - Admin delete any blog but Cannot update any blog.

- User role: 
    - User can register and log in.
    - Manage blogs, including adding, editing, or deleting blogs (only when logged in).

    - Enforced access control based on user roles to restrict unauthorized actions and enhance platform security.

    - Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure login

### Public API for Blogs:
A publicly accessible API to allow blog viewing with advanced functionalities:
- search: Search blogs by title or content (e.g., search=technology).
- sortBy: Sort blogs by specific fields such as createdAt or title.
